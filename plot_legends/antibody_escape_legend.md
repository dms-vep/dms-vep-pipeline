This is an interactive plot of how mutations affect antibody escape.

Use the site zoom bar at the top to zoom in on specific sites.
The line plot shows a summary statistic indicating escape at each site.
The heat map shows escape for individual mutations, with parental amino-acid identities indicated by **x** and gray indicating non-measured mutations.

You can mouse over points to get details about individual measurements.

The options at the bottom of the plot let you modify the display, such as by selecting how many different variants a mutation must be seen in to be shown (*minimum times seen*), how many different experimental replicates the mutation was measured in (*minimum n_models*), what site summary statistic to show, etc.

The *minimum max of escape at a site* is useful to select the sites where mutations confer the most escape.

For more details on the escape values and what they mean, see the documentation for the *polyclonal* software package at [https://jbloomlab.github.io/polyclonal/](https://jbloomlab.github.io/polyclonal/)
