This is an interactive plot of the functional effects of mutations.
Negative values indicate deleterious mutations, positive values indicate beneficial mutations for the measured phenotype.

Use the site zoom bar at the top to zoom in on specific sites.
The line plot shows a summary statistic indicating the effects of mutations at each site.
The heat map shows the effects of individual mutations, with parental amino-acid identities indicated by **x** and gray indicating non-measured mutations.

You can mouse over points to get details about individual measurements.

The options at the bottom of the plot let you modify the display, such as by selecting how many different variants a mutation must be seen in to be shown (*minimum times seen*), how many different experimental libraries the mutation was measured in (*minimum n_libraries*), what site summary statistic to show, etc.

The *minimum max of escape at a site* is useful to select the sites where mutations confer the most escape.
